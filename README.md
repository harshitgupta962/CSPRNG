# CSPRNG
Random Number Generator

This is a code for generating cryptographically secre pseudo random numbers using any graphical or musical file. The random numbers are generated by picking up random bits from the choosen file and then converting the bits into equivalent 2048 bit decimal which is the standard length of random numbers used in the industry. The random numbers generated are output into a text file.

The code follows secure coding standards and covers all the possible attacks scenarios on the code. Some of the scenarios covered are:-
Infinite loop due to an invalid request range of numbers to be generated
accepting random values or code from input field which should not be accpeted normally
Exception handling so that the errors generated do not reveal the internal structure of the code

The code can be modified to generate random numbers in a smaller range and smaller size. The code accepts the full path of the file being used to generate the random number.
